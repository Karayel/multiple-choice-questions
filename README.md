# freeCodeCamp Interview Beta

This app is the client side shell of [this quiz app](https://github.com/bonham000/react-quiz-app) and provides a practice testing and development environment for freeCodeCamp's multiple-choice interview questions.

**[It's running live here for you to practice on.](http://fcc-quiz.surge.sh/)**

The purpose of these challenges is to cover material that is currently not covered in the FCC Curriculum but nevertheless plays an important role in software engineering. In addition, these topics commonly appear in interview questions. Primary categories would be:

- **Common JavaScript Interview Questions**
- **Web Technologies & Web Standards**
- **Algorithm design/efficiency, time complexity, dynamic programming, etc.**
- **Data Structures and Database Technologies**
- **System Design**
- **Design Principles (OOP, FP, etc)**
- **Application & Web Security Questions**
- **DevOps, knowledge of cloud & server technologies (e.g. Heroku, AWS, Elasticsearch, memcached, etc.)**
- **... and more**

---

The challenges all live in the `src/challenges` directory. Each category has a separate `JSON` file which is structured like the other challenge seed files in the core freeCodeCamp repository. To contribute a challenge, simply make a pull request with your challenge question(s) in the appropriate seed file. To run this project locally, fork it to your machine and run `npm install` followed by `npm start` at the root level. Now you can add new questions and see them locally.

We are tracking and organizing these questions in the issues on this repository. Please go there to see what progress is being made and where you can help out if you are interested in helping. After we have a solid foundation of challenges and the freeCodeCamp app can support multiple-choice questions, these challenges can be migrated into freeCodeCamp proper.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
